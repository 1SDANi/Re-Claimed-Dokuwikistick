Scenario: A Divine Convoy has been spotted docking in the Truth and Reconcilliation, a ship Cortana disabled before abandoning the Autumn, if the ship is important enough for a Prophet to visit, Keyes has to be onboard
</p>

<p>
Twist: Hook Cortana up to the bridge computer so she can locate Keyes and let loose a few Destroyers to distract the Covenant, then free Keyes from his holding cell
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: Keyes is onboard and was interrogated by a Prophet, kept rambling about the ring, seemed relieved that Keyes didn&#039;t know “its true power”, escaped with Keyes in a Phantom
